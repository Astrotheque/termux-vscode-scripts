```

### 🔐 Secure Your Setup

  Run `code-server --auth password` and enter it on first login.

- Add HTTPS (recommended):
  Use **Let's Encrypt**, **Caddy**, or a **Cloudflare Tunnel**.

## 📲 Step 2: Connect from Fire Tablet or Android

1. **Install a browser** (Firefox works best on Fire OS)

2. **Launch your browser**
3. Navigate to your code-server URL:  
   `https://your-server.com:8080` or similar
